## 🚀 About The Project

**Velocity Drive X** pushes the boundaries of modern web development by integrating high-fidelity 3D graphics directly into the browser. The repository is structured for scalability, clean architecture, and rapid development, with a strong focus on UI consistency, fluid animations, and production-ready best practices.

Featuring the iconic yellow and green "Sultan" livery of the F1 GTR Longtail, this project serves as a masterclass in combining `@react-three/fiber` for 3D rendering with `framer-motion` for seamless DOM animations, all wrapped in a sleek, dark-themed UI.
